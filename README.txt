IMPORTANT: Follow all the instructions in the Jupyter Notebooks regarding installations of packages in order to be able to execute the Notebooks. 

1. Which files are relevant for the execution of the code

    a. "learn_all.ipynb" is the only Jupyter Notebook, that is relevant for the execution of the code in order to replicate the author's original results
    b. "learn_all 2019.ipynb" is the Jupyter Notebook that needs to be executed in order to see how the ODT Miner introduced by the authors performs on another event log (the one from the BPI Challenge 2019)


2. Output files

    a. Most ouputs will automatically show up in the "learn_all.ipynb" or "learn_all 2019.ipynb" Jupyter Notebooks when they are being executed.
    b. The output in form of the decision trees are stored to the seperate files "tree_paper.svg", "tree.svg" and "treebpic15_AEST.svg" in the folder "trees" in order to keep the Jupyter Notebooks clean.
    c. The ouputs of the ODT-Miner executions are stored in the files of the folder "results".


3. If you are interested in the original code files by the authors of the paper "No Time To Dice", take a look at the following GitHub Repository: https://github.com/roy-jingyang/Org-Learn_Exe_Context
